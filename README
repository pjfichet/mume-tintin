# mume-tintin
Tintin++ scripts to play Mume.

Mume (https://mume.org) is a multi-user dungeon which is easier to
play with a good telnet client, a set of aliases and scripts, and a
mapper. This project provides the aliases and scripts, made to work
in conjuction with:
- the tintin++ client (https://tintin.mudhalla.net/),
- the mume-map mapper (https://github.com/pjfichet/mume-map).
- or the mapperproxy-mume mapper
  (https://github.com/nstockton/mapperproxy-mume).

Mume-tintin is a fork of an abandonned project named tintin-mume by
Nstockton (https://github.com/nstockton/tintin-mume).

Mume-tintin is distributed under GPL license choosen by Nstockton
for his initial work.
